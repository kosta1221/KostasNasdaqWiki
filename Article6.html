				<h2>How Does The Nasdaq Make Money?</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Nasdaq (NDAQ) is the operator of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the second largest equities
					exchange in world by market capitalization of shares traded. At the end of 2019, a total
					of 3,140 companies traded shares on the Nasdaq in the U.S.1﻿ These companies represented
					$13.85 trillion in combined market cap as of May 2020, compared with $21 trillion for the
					New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
				</p>

				<br />
				<br />
				<p>
					Nasdaq has helped tech giants Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) become what
					they are today because these companies used Nasdaq during their early days to raise the
					much-needed capital in a timely manner, enabling them to become billion-dollar
					enterprises. Simply put, Nasdaq helps companies raise money and helps investors make
					money—but all of that help comes at a cost.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Where does all this money come from, you ask? In a nutshell, Nasdaq runs its business on
					fees. Companies pay a listing fee to appear on the Nasdaq stock exchange, investors pay
					transaction fees to trade, and users pay service fees to access market data, products,
					filing, and corporate services.
				</p>

				<br />
				<br />
				<p>
					Nasdaq manages, operates, and offers its various products and services through four
					different business segments: market services, corporate services, information services,
					and technology solutions.3﻿ Since Nasdaq is a public company, it is possible to see how
					each business segment contributes to revenues using the company's financial statements.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Market Services</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The market services segment charges for transactions from cash equity trading, derivatives
					trading, currency and commodity trading, clearing services, broker services and securities
					administration solutions. It supports trading for derivatives, commodities, cash equity,
					debt, structured products and exchange traded funds (ETFs)
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					In select countries, the market services segment also offers brokerage, clearing,
					settlement and depository services. Each of these is facilitated through the Nasdaq
					trading platform. The company charges investors fees to access orders and quotes for
					processing, displaying, integrating, routing executing, and reporting.6﻿ In 2019, market
					services accounted for 36.6% of the company's revenues.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Corporate Services</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Nasdaq offers capital raising solutions to global companies through its corporate, or
					listing services. In addition to a listing fee, the stock exchange charges fees for
					upcoming IPOs and to switch from other exchanges to Nasdaq.4﻿ In 2019, this segment
					accounted for 19% of Nasdaq's total revenue.

				<br />
				<br />
				<h2>Information Services</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					This segment includes the data products and index licensing and services businesses of
					Nasdaq. Data products and services involve the dissemination of proprietary Nasdaq data
					and third-party data, which essentially is the price quote and trade-related information.
					All market participants need market data for their research, trading, and investing
					activities. Nasdaq capitalizes on this through its data offerings, including products like
					Nasdaq TotalView and various data feeds of different exchanges and data levels (level 1
					data, level 2 data, and index data).
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Index licensing and services involves the quantitative development and licensing of
					various indexes used by various investment firms to issue financial products. Nasdaq
					charges a licensing fee from firms that use its index (or any constituent data). For
					example, if a trading firm wants to launch a new ETF on the popular Nasdaq 100 Index, it
					will have to pay a licensing fee to Nasdaq. Nasdaq currently maintains thousands of
					indexes through its Nasdaq Global Index family across 45 countries. It also provides
					custom calculations for clients on their select set of securities. Revenues from the
					information services segment accounted for 24.4% of Nasdaq's revenue in 2019.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Market Technology</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The market technology segment offers services to over 10,000 corporate clients through two
					streams: corporate solutions and market technology solutions. Corporate solutions include
					services for investor relations (content, analytics, advisory services, and communications
					tools), public relations (management of company public relations through targeted
					contacts, press releases, social media, and webcasts), and governance (services for
					effective communication and collaboration across different stakeholders).
				</p>

					alt="image"
				/>
				<br />
				<br />
				<p>
					The market technology stream covers the technology solutions of Nasdaq’s diversified
					client base (global exchanges, clearing corporations, securities depositories, market
					regulators, banks, brokerage firms, and corporate businesses). A wide variety of solutions
					are available for trading, clearing, settlement, surveillance, and information
					dissemination. In terms of revenue, market technology is the smallest segment, as it
					represented 10.2% of revenue in 2019.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Nasdaq has managed to diversify its offerings to keep pace with market developments.
					Sources of revenue for Nasdaq are charges for transactions, licensing fees, listing fees,
					and revenue from data products, in addition to technology products and services.3﻿ Through
					a healthy mix of organic growth, acquisitions, and mergers, Nasdaq continues to maintain
					its position as one of the top global exchanges.
