				<h2>Origins of The Nasdaq</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Nasdaq officially separated from the NASD and began to operate as a national securities
					exchange in 2006. In 2007, it combined with the Scandinavian exchange group OMX to become
					the Nasdaq OMX group, which is the largest exchange company globally, powering 1 in 10 of
					the world’s securities transactions. Headquartered in New York, Nasdaq OMX operates 25
					markets – primarily equities, and also including options, fixed income, derivatives and
					commodities – as well as one clearinghouse and five central securities depositories in the
					U.S. and Europe. Its cutting-edge trading technology is used by 70 exchanges in 50
					countries. It is listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol NDAQ and has been part of the S&P
					500 since 2008. The Nasdaq computerized trading system was initially devised as an
					alternative to the inefficient “specialist” system, which had been the prevalent model for
					almost a century. The rapid evolution of technology has made the Nasdaq’s electronic
					trading model the standard for markets worldwide. As a leader in trading technology from
					the outset, it was only fitting that the world’s technology giants chose to list on the
					Nasdaq in their early days. As the technology sector grew in prominence in the 1980s and
					1990s, the Nasdaq became the most widely followed proxy for this sector. The technology
					and dot-com boom and bust of the late 1990s is exemplified by the rise and fall of the
					Nasdaq Composite during this period. The index crossed the 1,000 mark for the first time
					in July 1995, soared in the following years and peaked at over 4,500 in March 2000, before
					slumping almost 80% by October 2002 in the subsequent correction.
