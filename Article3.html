				<h2>The Nasdaq 100 Index</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Nasdaq 100 Index is a basket of the 100 largest, most actively traded U.S companies
					listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The index includes companies from various industries
					except for the financial industry, like commercial and investment banks. These
					non-financial sectors include retail, biotechnology, industrial, technology, health care,
					and others.
				</p>

				<br />
				<h2>Weighting the Index</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The index is constructed on a modified capitalization methodology. This modified method
					uses individual weights of included items according to their market capitalization.
					Weighting allows constraints to limit the influence of the largest companies and balance
					the index with all members. To accomplish this, Nasdaq reviews the composition of the
					index each quarter and adjust weightings if the distribution requirements are not met.
				</p>

				<br />
				<h2>Trading the Nasdaq 100 Index</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Nasdaq 100 is traded through the Invesco QQQ Trust. This product is designed to track
					the performance of the 100 largest companies on the Nasdaq exchange. Each company in the
					trust must be a member of the Nasdaq 100 and be listed on the broader exchange for at
					least two years. Also, listed stocks need to have an average daily trading volume of
					200,000 and publicly report earnings quarterly and annually. Some exceptions are made for
					newly public companies that have extremely high market capitalizations. Companies with
					bankruptcy issues are omitted from the Invesco QQQ Trust. On occasion, the composition of
					the trust may not identically match the Index, but the main objective of the QQQ is still
					to track the price and performance of the underlying index.
				</p>

				<h2>Composition of the Nasdaq 100 Index</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Nasdaq 100 Index is composed of assets in various sectors, excluding financial
					services. A large portion of the index covers the technology sector, which accounts for
					54% of the index's weight. The next largest sector is consumer services, represented by
					companies like restaurant chains, retailers, and travel services. These stocks account for
					nearly a quarter of the cap weight thanks to the continued growth of retail giant Amazon
					(AMZN). Rounding out the index is healthcare, industrials, and telecommunications. The
					diversity of companies included in the Nasdaq 100 helped drive strong returns for the past
					two decades.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Criteria for Eligibility</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					For inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, index securities must be listed exclusively on a Nasdaq
					exchange. This can include common stocks, ordinary shares, American depositary receipts
					(ADRs), and tracking stocks. Twenty-seven countries are tied to companies represented in
					the index. Other grounds for inclusion comprise market capitalization and liquidity. While
					there is no minimum requirement for market capitalization, the index itself represents the
					top 100 largest companies listed on the Nasdaq.
