				<h2>What is the Nasdaq Composite Index?</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Nasdaq Composite Index is the market capitalization-weighted index of over 2,500
					common equities listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The types of securities in the index
					include American depositary receipts, common stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs)
					and tracking stocks, as well as limited partnership interests. The index includes all
					Nasdaq-listed stocks that are not derivatives, preferred shares, funds, exchange-traded
					funds (ETFs) or debenture securities.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Understanding Nasdaq Composite Index</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Nasdaq Composite is not limited to companies that have U.S. headquarters—something
					that sets it apart from a number of other indexes. It is very common to hear the closing
					price of the Nasdaq Composite Index reported in the financial press or as part of the
					evening news because it is such a broad-based market index.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Nasdaq Methodology</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Nasdaq Composite Index uses a market capitalization weighting methodology. The index's
					value equals the total value of the share weights of each of the constituent securities,
					multiplied by each security's last price. This total is then adjusted by dividing by an
					index divisor, which scales the value to a more appropriate figure for reporting purposes.
					The index is calculated continuously throughout the trading day, but it is reported once
					per second, with the final confirmed value being reported at 4:16 p.m. each trading day.
					Two versions of the Nasdaq Composite Index are calculated: a price return index and a
					total return index. The total return index includes the reinvestment of cash dividends on
					their respective dividend ex-dates. Both versions of the index include non-dividend cash
					distributions. On the market close of Sept. 24, 2003, both versions of the index were
					synchronized. Changes in price due to corporate actions such as stock splits, stock
					dividends or spinoffs are made on the action's ex-date. Changes in total shares
					outstanding due to items such as conversions, stock repurchases, secondary offerings or
					acquisitions are usually made on the night before the action's effective date. Eligibility
					requirements for the index are reviewed throughout the year. A security that does not meet
					the eligibility requirements can be removed at any time, usually at its last sale price.
				</p>

				<h2>Nasdaq Composite Eligibility Criteria</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					To be eligible for inclusion in the Nasdaq Composite Index, the security's U.S. listing
					must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Stock Market (unless the security was dually listed on
					another U.S. market prior to January 1, 2004, and has continuously maintained such
					listing). The type of security must be one of the following:
				</p>
				<br />
				<ul id="wiki-list">
					<li>American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)</li>
					<li>Common Stock</li>
					<li>Limited Partnership Interests</li>
					<li>Ordinary Shares</li>
					<li>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</li>
					<li>Shares of Beneficial Interest (SBIs)</li>
					<li>Tracking Stocks</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>
					Security types ineligible for inclusion are closed-end funds, convertible debentures,
					exchange-traded funds, preferred stocks, rights, warrants, units, and other derivative
					securities. A security is removed from the Composite Index if eligibility criteria are no
					longer met.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Nasdaq Composite Composition</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					As of March 15, 2020, the industry weights of the Nasdaq Composite Index's individual
					securities are as follows: technology at 48.39%, consumer services at 19.43%, health care
					at 10.21%, financials at 7.21%, industrials at 6.85%, consumer goods at 5.51%, utilities
					at 0.81%, telecommunications at 0.72%, oil and gas at 0.55% and basis materials at 0.32%.
